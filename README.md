# homebase
WhatWare HomeBase application

This is a simple python app that has lots of basic functions.

### dependencies

Run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the directory of `requirements.txt`

### dev version info

The dev version is only tested on windows until we are ready to release a new version, then we test it on all platforms. Because of this, some functions may not work and it may be unstable on operating systems other than windows. Your best bet if you don't know anything about python is to comment out the line. `#comment it with a hashtag like this`

### other info

The `settings.json` file in the main directory is unused. Homebase creates the settings file in your operating systems appdata folder. On windows, this is `C:\Users\[user]\AppData\Local\WhatWare\Homebase`, Mac OS X `/Users/[user]/Library/Application Support/Homebase`, and Linux `/home/[user]/.local/share/Homebase`.

We used a sound from the Yaru theme by Ubuntu. Alarm.wav is modified from https://github.com/ubuntu/yaru/blob/master/sounds/src/stereo/desktop-login.oga
